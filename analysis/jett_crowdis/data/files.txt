data/nbl-cohort-singletons.csv: simply a subset of the main SV file for more efficient loading in various notebooks

data/gmkf-expression: neuroblastoma RSEM expression files obtained from https://portal.kidsfirstdrc.org/login. Please sign up for this portal to obtain these data. There are 210 files, each ~9 Mb in size, and a manifest file (GMKF_neuroblastoma_transcriptomic_data_manifest_rsem_gene_files_2_22_22.txt) is used for file mapping.

data/cwas/reference-counts.csv: A large intermediate file.

data/cwas/intergenic-sv-to-gene-distances.csv: a large intermediate file generated by a notebook.

data/cwas/results: a collection of large files generated by the notebooks (results)

data/cwas/svs-in-categories: these files are required to run these notebooks but too large to store on github. These files detail which SVs are in each category. An example file named is ewing_all_noncoding_SVs_in_each_category_list_combined_BURDEN_TESTING_with_col_names_8_9_24.txt. They have the following columns: SV	chrom	start	end	category.

data/rna/svs-for-sv-rna-analysis.csv: A subset of the overall SV file for more efficient file processing.

data/rna/dosages-for-sv-rna-analysis.csv: A subset of the dosage file for more efficient file processing.

data/rna/gmkf_neuroblastoma_tpms.csv: A TPM matrix generated from the GMKF RSEM expression files (generated by the preprocessing RNA notebook). Cannot be committed because it is restricted data.

data/targeted-genes: Result files from the targeted gene analyses.
