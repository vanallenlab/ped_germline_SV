# Style Guide

This note is intended to explain various choices in analysis and formatting used in my analyses

## Code formatting

All Python code should be formatted using [Black](https://github.com/psf/black). There are some undesirable features of Black, but on the whole it results in more readable code. If you use the virtual environment, black should be useable within Jupyter Notebook/Jupyter Lab.
