# Gameplan

This is just a small notebook for me to take notes on analyses that need to be done. Our role in this project is going to be focusing on the following spreadsheet #22: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Kaho8r_lVR1Ua0gEcnPOhyEhgNXfhX5syrt0Y3DLGtU/edit#gid=0

We're focusing on breakpoints near known somatic SVs specific to each histology.

## EWSR1-FLI1

I've done some initial work on the EWSR1-FLI1 region, which does indeed have a few SVs. I have a decent handle on what's going on in the region, so it's time to dig into the statistics.

## Extraneous thoughts

EWSR1-FLI1 is a transcription factor that targets specific motifs (GGAA). One interesting idea could be to determine if these regions are significantly affected by SVs in Ewing's samples. This has been shown in the SNP space (one implicated SNP creates a function GGAA sequence).

### Todo:

- Go through and classify/interpret all these SVs
- Actually visualize some allele frequencies/odds ratios
- Read https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/stata/seminars/deciphering-interactions-in-logistic-regression/ to understand.
