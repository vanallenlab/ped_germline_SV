### Questions

So I met with Riaz, and we chatted for a bit. He had some really excellent thoughts. I think I've landed on a few different ways and plans forward:

1. I think the EWSR1-FLI1 joint stuff isn't particularly interesting (it'll be good to get Ryan's thoughts).
    - For this project, I think two points remain: seeing if the signal validates in the other cohort and examine functional genetic elements (e.g. TAD boundaries, etc). Neither of these is particularly pressing.
    
2. For neuroblastoma, we have the MYCN results, and Riaz has also noted from work with Cora that TERT and ALK are also commonly rearranged.
    - We can repeat this entire process with TERT and ALK, it's not difficult.
    - Somatic-germline interactions are a bit more difficult to parse. The real saving grace would be if we have somatic-germline interactions VERIFIABLE WITHIN A SINGLE TUMOR. This would likely involve examinining individual germline and somatic variation within individual tumors are devising a framework for analysis. Would likely be a much deeper dive.
    
I think that both of these points can wait until the callsets are better defined. We can maybe do TERT and ALK, since that's quite easy to add to our workflow.

Questions:
    1. For SV burden testing, how do you think about amplifications vs. deletions? An amplification in cases could be "balanced" by a deletion in controls, but the SV burden would be the same. Do you do burden with individual SV classes?
    
### Follow up with new data

1. I've noticed that some significant SVs by eye don't hit significance due to quasi separation (see notebook). What's up with this?
